You are working from a London office, when a colleague from New York reaches out and asks you for help.

Several customers have reported difficulties accessing the web service. He is on his way to the office, but the issue is critical.

The colleague has determined the issue might be related to the DNS availability but asks you to investigate in detail.

## Instructions

1. Your first task is to analyze the outage. Determine the nature of the issue and impacted locations.

2. Your second task is to identify the responsible party.

3. Finding potential root cause always allows you to be more successful when escalating the issue. This is your last task.

## Troubleshooting
